'Our transformer encoder, written in PyTorch, is composed of 12 transformer encoder layers plus 12 transformer decoder layers. The output dimensionality of all the sub-layers, as well as the embedding layers in both encoder and decoder, was set to 1024. Besides this, each Multi-Head attention layer of our transformer model was formed of 16 attention heads in total. We used dropout [89] heavily; its value for the complete transformer model was set to 20%. Lastly, the dimensionality of the feed-forward layer present inside all of the transformer encoder and decoder layers, and applied to every position individually, was set at 4096.'
